Epinova.CRMFramework
====================

Epinova.CRMFramework allows developers to create, read, update and delete Microsoft Dynamics CRM entities from any .NET application. It supports operations on all standard and custom CRM entities and attributes, and retrieving one-to-one and one-to-many CRM entity relationships.

How does it work?
=================

Check out the [Epinova.CRMFramework 2.0 Overview](https://github.com/karolikl/Epinova.CRMFramework/wiki/Epinova.CRMFramework-2.0-Overview) page to see what the framework can do.

Looking for a framework compatible with Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013?
====================================================================
Epinova.CRMFramwork 2.0 is compatible with Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013, the only thing you have to do is replace the Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk assemblies with the updated 2013 assemblies found on Nuget. 
There will be created a separate branch in this project compatible with Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 shortly.

Looking for a framework compatible with Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0?
===================================================================
Epinova.CRMFramework 1.0 is compatible with Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0, but it is still on [Codeplex](http://crmframework.codeplex.com/). It will be moved here shortly.
